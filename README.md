# Car Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project utilizes car sales data to perform a comprehensive analysis and derive insightful visualizations. The primary focus is on understanding the factors that influence car prices and sales trends. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook, which includes the following key components:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
* Data Visualization: Creating various plots and charts to visualize the distribution and relationships between different variables.
* Statistical Analysis: Performing descriptive statistics to summarize the data.

## Feature Engineering
* Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that influence car prices.
* Feature Transformation: Transforming and scaling features for better modeling.

# Model Building
* Linear Regression: Building a linear regression model to predict car prices based on selected features.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* Train-Test Split: Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's generalizability.

## Getting Started
* Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

### Kaggle API Setup:
Ensure you have your Kaggle API token (kaggle.json) set up on your local environment for downloading the dataset.
